# Java Learning Journey

This repository documents my process of **retaking** a complete Java course. I'm going through the content again from the beginning, with the goal of truly understanding the fundamentals and building a solid foundation in Java development.

## Course Topics

The course is structured in modules, covering a wide range of topics:

- Java Basics: variables, data types, operators, control flow
- Scanner, Math, and String classes
- Arrays and loops (for, while, foreach)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Advanced OOP: abstract classes, interfaces, enums, exceptions
- Java Collections: Lists, Sets, Maps
- Testing with JUnit, build tools with Maven, and mocking with Mockito
- Databases with MySQL and JDBC
- Java Persistence API (JPA)
- Web development with Spring Framework
- REST APIs using Spring and Postman

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a section of the course, organized by number and topic. It includes exercises, activities, and small programs I've written while learning.

## Purpose

- To relearn Java from the ground up
- To practice daily and build consistency
- To keep track of my progress and stay motivated
- To develop good programming habits and clean code practices

## How to Run

Each program contains a `main()` method and can be compiled and run from the terminal or any Java IDE:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```
